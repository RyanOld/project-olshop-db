# Online Shop Database

This app is the database half of the online shop project I made to pass one of my university classes.
##

## How to Run
This app is made using Javascript with an npm task runner for development mode and production mode. 
###
Before running the app, clone this repository to a folder and open a terminal in said folder.
###

### How to Run on Dev Mode :
```bash
  npm run dev
```

### How to Run on Prod Mode :
```bash
  npm run start
```

## NOTE : 
###
Because it was originally made to be using Heroku's free plan and their PostGreSQL plugin, the production data are stored in their cloud storage.
###
And after they decided to discontinue free plan support, all my PostGreSQL data are nuked. All that remains are the schema.
